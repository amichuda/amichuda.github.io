Working Papers \u00b6 Labor Supply Adjustment to Adverse Agricultural Shocks: A Study of Uber and the Gig Economy\\ Dissertation Topic In the developing world, there is little evidence on the added value of the flexibility provided by the gig economy We study the effects of shocks and as a way to see how flexibility in payment and choosing hours can aid in poverty alleviation. We use a novel method of connecting drivers to their rural places of origin using a machine learning classification using driver surnames We evaluate the existence of a shock based on a drought indices to find how adverse shocks affect labor supply behavior. \"Revisiting Selection and Comparative Advantage in Technology Adoption: A Structural Approach.\\\" with Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Jeffrey D.
