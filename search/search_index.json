The biggest lockdown was the one declared by the Indian government. All economic activity was shut down overnight, impacting the lives of the nation\u2019s 1.3 billion people. The economic impacts of lockdowns on the poor are little understood because the data have not been available. We have been tracking the weekly financial activities of a sample of poor households in rural India for over a year. Using this unique high-frequency weekly data before India\u2019s COVID-19 lockdown and supplementing that dataset with phone-call surveys conducted on the same households for four weeks after the lockdown announcement, we econometrically estimate the impacts of the lockdown. Our analysis reveals that in the first four weeks after India\u2019s lockdown announcement, poor households lost INR 1,022 (US$ 13.5), which is about 88 percent of their average weekly income from the previous year. In addition to the income loss, households reduced meal portions and consumed fewer food items. The poorer households were hit harder, but government food aid slightly mitigated the negative impacts. PDF A Group Random Coefficient Approach to Modeling Heterogeneous Returns to Technology Adoption \u00b6 with Emilia Tjernstrom, Dalia Ghanem, Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Travis J. Lybbert, and Jeffrey D. Michler Abstract Our paper revisits the econometric model that Suri (2011) (S2011) used in her study of heterogeneous returns to agricultural technology adoption. We propose an alternative group random coefficient (GRC) estimation strategy and revisit the empirical puzzle of why relatively few sub-Saharan farmers adopt modern technologies. Drawing on recent developments in the nonparametric panel identification literature, we start with an unrestricted GRC model that nonparametrically identifies the returns to adoption under time homogeneity. We show that the parameters of the S2011 correlated random coefficient model (CRC) can be identified from a restricted version of the GRC method. Specifically, the model in S2011 implies a key restriction that we call linearity in comparative advantage (LCA). Our unrestricted GRC model can be used to detect identification concerns for key structural parameters from the CRC model. We illustrate our method using the same data set as the original study and find that the motivating empirical puzzle remains unsolved.

Bird The Russian Mir \u00b6 With Jonathan Conning Specialty Crops \u00b6 Evaluating a Systems Approach to Suppressive Crop Rotations in Strawberry Production \u00b6 With Rachael Goodhue, Daniel Chellemi, and Krishna Subbarao Abstract We evaluate a new, dynamic approach to suppressive crop rotations, which incorporate flexibility in cropping decisions. This \u201csystems\u201d approach allows a grower to change their cropping decisions mid-rotation and plant higher value crops to address cash constraints while recognizing the effect of doing so on V. dahliae populations in the soil. A grower can plant broccoli to suppress the amount of microsclerotia ($\\mu s$) of disease in the soil, or plant lettuce if they need more cash in the current period. This flexibility represents a dynamic tradeoff whose intention is for suppressive crop rotations, but more broadly, it is relevant for any multi-crop production system. These production schemes must take streams of profits into account (not just profits from each crop separately), as well as any dynamic spillovers that crops may have on each other. We use the results of a field study to calibrate a dynamic model to investigate how much this flexibility can change grower net returns, as well as how different market conditions, specifically expected prices, and levels of vertical coordination can change growers\u2019 rotation decisions in this systems context.

This study investigates whether the application of steam is an economically sustainable pre-plant soil disinfestation technique for organic and conventional strawberry production in California\u2019s Central Coast region. We analyze net returns ha -1 from field trials using steam and steam + mustard seed meal (MSM) as pre-plant soil disinfestation treatments. ANOVA tests identify statistically significant differences in net revenues by treatment and trial. Multivariate regressions estimate the magnitude of these effects. Predictive polynomial models identify relationships between net returns ha -1 and two treatment characteristics: maximum temperature (\u2070 C) and time at \u2265 60\u2070 C (minutes). For organic production, net returns ha -1 are statistically similar for the steam and steam + MSM treatments. For conventional production, the steam + MSM treatment has significantly higher net returns ha -1 than the steam treatment. Polynomial models outperform the sample mean for prediction of net returns ha -1 except for the steam + MSM treatment in conventional production. Results from two of three organic models suggest that maximum soil temperatures of 62-63\u2070 C achieved for 41-44 minutes maximizes net returns ha -1 and may be a basis for further experiments.","title":"Working Papers/Ongoing Projects"},{"location":"research/working/#ongoing-projectsworking-papers","text":"","title":"Ongoing Projects/Working Papers"},{"location":"research/working/#development","text":"","title":"Development"},{"location":"research/working/#economic-burden-of-covid-19-lockdown-on-the-poor","text":"With Anubhab Gupta, Heng Zhu, Miki Khanh Doan, and Binoy Majumder Revise and Resubmit at the American Journal of Agricultural Economics Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic caused the largest number of lockdowns across the globe, affecting nearly half of the world\u2019s population by the first week of April 2020. The biggest lockdown was the one declared by the Indian government. All economic activity was shut down overnight, impacting the lives of the nation\u2019s 1.3 billion people. The economic impacts of lockdowns on the poor are little understood because the data have not been available. We have been tracking the weekly financial activities of a sample of poor households in rural India for over a year. Using this unique high-frequency weekly data before India\u2019s COVID-19 lockdown and supplementing that dataset with phone-call surveys conducted on the same households for four weeks after the lockdown announcement, we econometrically estimate the impacts of the lockdown. Our analysis reveals that in the first four weeks after India\u2019s lockdown announcement, poor households lost INR 1,022 (US$ 13.5), which is about 88 percent of their average weekly income from the previous year. In addition to the income loss, households reduced meal portions and consumed fewer food items. The poorer households were hit harder, but government food aid slightly mitigated the negative impacts.

Lybbert, and Jeffrey D. Michler Abstract Our paper revisits the econometric model that Suri (2011) (S2011) used in her study of heterogeneous returns to agricultural technology adoption. We propose an alternative group random coefficient (GRC) estimation strategy and revisit the empirical puzzle of why relatively few sub-Saharan farmers adopt modern technologies. Drawing on recent developments in the nonparametric panel identification literature, we start with an unrestricted GRC model that nonparametrically identifies the returns to adoption under time homogeneity. We show that the parameters of the S2011 correlated random coefficient model (CRC) can be identified from a restricted version of the GRC method. Specifically, the model in S2011 implies a key restriction that we call linearity in comparative advantage (LCA). Our unrestricted GRC model can be used to detect identification concerns for key structural parameters from the CRC model. We illustrate our method using the same data set as the original study and find that the motivating empirical puzzle remains unsolved.

This \u201csystems\u201d approach allows a grower to change their cropping decisions mid-rotation and plant higher value crops to address cash constraints while recognizing the effect of doing so on V. dahliae populations in the soil. A grower can plant broccoli to suppress the amount of microsclerotia ($\\mu s$) of disease in the soil, or plant lettuce if they need more cash in the current period. This flexibility represents a dynamic tradeoff whose intention is for suppressive crop rotations, but more broadly, it is relevant for any multi-crop production system. These production schemes must take streams of profits into account (not just profits from each crop separately), as well as any dynamic spillovers that crops may have on each other. We use the results of a field study to calibrate a dynamic model to investigate how much this flexibility can change grower net returns, as well as how different market conditions, specifically expected prices, and levels of vertical coordination can change growers\u2019 rotation decisions in this systems context.","title":"Evaluating a Systems Approach to Suppressive Crop Rotations in Strawberry Production"},{"location":"research/working/#predicting-net-returns-of-organic-and-conventional-strawberry-following-soil-disinfestation-with-steam-or-steam-plus-additives","text":"With Rachael Goodhue, Mark Hoffmann and Steve A.
