Remittances are often a key driver of these linkages and can act as insurance against rural weather shock risk, in the absence of availability and access to formal insurance products. The emergence of new technologies, such as gig economy platforms and mobile money, can be potentially transformative at allowing remittance flows to adjust more quickly to adverse shocks. I use a dataset of Uber driver labor supply and a rich dataset of weather indicators to estimate the effect of adverse weather shocks in rural areas on Uber drivers in Kampala, Uganda. Since I do not have explicit information on migrant status and rural connection, I leverage an external dataset of Ugandan voter registration and train a gradient boosting classifier on Ugandan surnames to predict which regions drivers are connected to. I develop a switching regression estimator to address the misclassification bias from the predictions. I find that a one standard deviation increase in the intensity of agricultural drought leads to an increase of 5.1 hours online in the month of the event (a 6% increase over average hours), providing suggestive evidence that Uber\u2019s flexibility is used to buffer against adverse weather shocks \\normalsize Working Papers \u00b6 Tjernstr\u00f6m, Emilia, Dalia Ghanem, Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Travis J.

Utilizing weekly financial transaction data collected from households residing in a rural region of India, we estimate the impacts of India's COVID\u201019 lockdown on household income, food security, welfare, and access to local loan markets. A large portion of households living in our study region is reliant on remittances from migrants to sustain their livelihoods. Our analysis reveals that in the month immediately after India's lockdown announcement, weekly household local income fell by INR 1,022 (US$ 13.5), an 88% drop compared to the long\u2010term average with another 63% reduction in remittance. In response to the massive loss in earnings, households substantially reduced meal portions and consumed fewer food items. Impacts were heterogeneous; households in lower income quantiles lost a higher percentage of their income and expenditures, but government food aid slightly mitigated the negative impacts. We also find an increase in the effective interest rate of local borrowing in cash and a higher demand for in\u2010kind loans, which are likely to have an adverse effect on households who rely on such services. The results from this paper have immediate relevance to policymakers considering additional lockdowns as the COVID\u201019 pandemic resurges around the globe and to governments thinking about responses to future pandemics that may occur.

While this approach has been around for a decade, its use has been limited by the computationally intensive nature of the estimation procedure that relies on the optimal minimum distance estimator. randcoef can accommodate up to five rounds of panel data and offers several options, including alternative weight matrices for estimation and inclusion of additional endogenous regressors.

A trial using suppressive crop rotations to combat Verticillium wilt was conducted to see its effects on strawberry yields and net returns using a split-split-plot design. An ANOVA analysis was run to understand determinants of net returns. Results show that the suppression of wilt through the planting of non-host crops such as broccoli before the planting of strawberries can have significant effects on yield and net returns, and that suppressive crop rotations are potentially commercially viable.

Lybbert, and Jeffrey D. Michler Abstract Our paper revisits the econometric model that Suri (2011) (S2011) used in her study of heterogeneous returns to agricultural technology adoption. We propose an alternative group random coefficient (GRC) estimation strategy and revisit the empirical puzzle of why relatively few sub-Saharan farmers adopt modern technologies. Drawing on recent developments in the nonparametric panel identification literature, we start with an unrestricted GRC model that nonparametrically identifies the returns to adoption under time homogeneity. We show that the parameters of the S2011 correlated random coefficient model (CRC) can be identified from a restricted version of the GRC method. Specifically, the model in S2011 implies a key restriction that we call linearity in comparative advantage (LCA). Our unrestricted GRC model can be used to detect identification concerns for key structural parameters from the CRC model. We illustrate our method using the same data set as the original study and find that the motivating empirical puzzle remains unsolved. PDF Identity, Location, and Voting in Uganda \u00b6 With Samuel S. Bird Abstract This paper disentangles the effects of a voter's regional identity and their location of residence on their voting behavior. We estimate this effect by pairing voter registration data with election outcomes for polling stations throughout Uganda. We overcome the challenge of measuring identity by using a machine learning algorithm that exploits variation in ethnic and linguistic groups across regions of Uganda. In particular, we use the letter sequences in each individual voter's surname to predict their regional identity. We then use regional identity as the explanatory variable of interest in a regression model of support for the incumbent president in the 2016 general election. We identify our estimate of the regional identity effect with a model that controls for the sub-regional location of the polling station. Comparing results with and without location controls allows us to estimate the relative roles of regional identity itself and location-specific effects on observed voting behavior. The Russian Mir \u00b6 With Jonathan Conning Specialty Crops \u00b6 Evaluating a Systems Approach to Suppressive Crop Rotations in Strawberry Production \u00b6 With Rachael Goodhue, Daniel Chellemi, and Krishna Subbarao Abstract We evaluate a new, dynamic approach to suppressive crop rotations, which incorporate flexibility in cropping decisions. This \u201csystems\u201d approach allows a grower to change their cropping decisions mid-rotation and plant higher value crops to address cash constraints while recognizing the effect of doing so on V. dahliae populations in the soil. A grower can plant broccoli to suppress the amount of microsclerotia ($\\mu s$) of disease in the soil, or plant lettuce if they need more cash in the current period. This flexibility represents a dynamic tradeoff whose intention is for suppressive crop rotations, but more broadly, it is relevant for any multi-crop production system. These production schemes must take streams of profits into account (not just profits from each crop separately), as well as any dynamic spillovers that crops may have on each other. We use the results of a field study to calibrate a dynamic model to investigate how much this flexibility can change grower net returns, as well as how different market conditions, specifically expected prices, and levels of vertical coordination can change growers\u2019 rotation decisions in this systems context. Predicting net returns of organic and conventional strawberry following soil disinfestation with steam or steam plus additives \u00b6 With Rachael Goodhue, Mark Hoffmann and Steve A. Fennimore Abstract Pre-plant methods for managing soil-borne pests and diseases are an important priority for many agricultural production systems. This study investigates whether the application of steam is an economically sustainable pre-plant soil disinfestation technique for organic and conventional strawberry production in California\u2019s Central Coast region. We analyze net returns ha -1 from field trials using steam and steam + mustard seed meal (MSM) as pre-plant soil disinfestation treatments. ANOVA tests identify statistically significant differences in net revenues by treatment and trial. Multivariate regressions estimate the magnitude of these effects. Predictive polynomial models identify relationships between net returns ha -1 and two treatment characteristics: maximum temperature (\u2070 C) and time at \u2265 60\u2070 C (minutes). For organic production, net returns ha -1 are statistically similar for the steam and steam + MSM treatments. For conventional production, the steam + MSM treatment has significantly higher net returns ha -1 than the steam treatment. Polynomial models outperform the sample mean for prediction of net returns ha -1 except for the steam + MSM treatment in conventional production. Results from two of three organic models suggest that maximum soil temperatures of 62-63\u2070 C achieved for 41-44 minutes maximizes net returns ha -1 and may be a basis for further experiments.","title":"Working Papers/Ongoing Projects"},{"location":"research/working.html#ongoing-projectsworking-papers","text":"","title":"Ongoing Projects/Working Papers"},{"location":"research/working.html#development","text":"","title":"Development"},{"location":"research/working.html#a-group-random-coefficient-approach-to-modeling-heterogeneous-returns-to-technology-adoption","text":"With Emilia Tjernstrom, Dalia Ghanem, Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Travis J.
