These linkages are expressed through internal migration, ownership of land and other assets across regions. To measure the existence and strength of these links, we have traditionally relied on data collected from household surveys that ask about migration, asset ownership and other factors. However, there are situations where collecting data or matching data across datasets may be infeasible. This paper uses a novel dataset of Uber driver hours and a rich dataset of weather indicators to estimate the effect of adverse weather shocks in rural areas on driver\u2019s labor supply in Kampala, Uganda. Since regional connection is not collected by Uber, I use gradient boosting on Ugandan surnames to predict which regions those drivers are connected to, and develop a maximum likelihood estimator that is robust to the misclassification bias. I find that a one standard deviation increase in intensity of agricultural drought leads to an increase in monthly hours in the month of the drought, by 4.2 hours, and 3 months post drought, by 3.5 hours. This paper creates a framework on how to use big data and machine learning to overcome issues of limited data, measures rural-urban links and helps to understand the flexibility of the gig economy in developing countries.

The biggest lockdown was the one declared by the Indian government. All economic activity was shut down overnight, impacting the lives of the nation\u2019s 1.3 billion people. The economic impacts of lockdowns on the poor are little understood because the data have not been available. We have been tracking the weekly financial activities of a sample of poor households in rural India for over a year. Using this unique high-frequency weekly data before India\u2019s COVID-19 lockdown and supplementing that dataset with phone-call surveys conducted on the same households for four weeks after the lockdown announcement, we econometrically estimate the impacts of the lockdown. Our analysis reveals that in the first four weeks after India\u2019s lockdown announcement, poor households lost INR 1,022 (US$ 13.5), which is about 88 percent of their average weekly income from the previous year. In addition to the income loss, households reduced meal portions and consumed fewer food items. The poorer households were hit harder, but government food aid slightly mitigated the negative impacts. PDF Applied Econometrics \u00b6 Fitting and interpreting correlated random-coefficient models using Stata. \u00b6 With Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Jeffrey D. Michler and Emilia Tjernstrom Abstract In this article, we introduce the community-contributed command randcoef, which fits the correlated random-effects and correlated random-coefficient models discussed in Suri (2011, Econometrica 79: 159\u2013209). While this approach has been around for a decade, its use has been limited by the computationally intensive nature of the estimation procedure that relies on the optimal minimum distance estimator. randcoef can accommodate up to five rounds of panel data and offers several options, including alternative weight matrices for estimation and inclusion of additional endogenous regressors. We also present postestimation analysis using sample data to facilitate understanding and interpretation of results.
