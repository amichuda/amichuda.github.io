These linkages are expressed through internal migration, ownership of land and other assets across regions. To measure the existence and strength of these links, we have traditionally relied on data collected from household surveys that ask about migration, asset ownership and other factors. However, there are situations where collecting data or matching data across datasets may be infeasible. This paper uses a novel dataset of Uber driver hours and a rich dataset of weather indicators to estimate the effect of adverse weather shocks in rural areas on driver\u2019s labor supply in Kampala, Uganda. Since regional connection is not collected by Uber, I use gradient boosting on Ugandan surnames to predict which regions those drivers are connected to, and develop a maximum likelihood estimator that is robust to the misclassification bias. I find that a one standard deviation increase in intensity of agricultural drought leads to an increase in monthly hours in the month of the drought, by 4.2 hours, and 3 months post drought, by 3.5 hours. This paper creates a framework on how to use big data and machine learning to overcome issues of limited data, measures rural-urban links and helps to understand the flexibility of the gig economy in developing countries.
