While resting on defensible theoretical foundations, the argument for large-scale redistribution gave way to microfinance and other less radical interventions intended to allow low wealth households to do more with their existing, modest asset endowments. While also resting on defensible theoretical foundations, this \u201clend, don\u2019t redistribute wealth\u201d perspective coincided with a shift of development economics away from big picture theorizing towards an impact evaluation economics focused on reliable identification of microfinance and other singular interventions. Interestingly, despite the promise of microfinance to substitute for asset redistribution, impact evaluation economics found it to have at best modest effects on the class positions and living standards of poor households. In a perhaps ironic twist, a new generation of programs built around the transfer of tangible assets has shown much more promise in terms of changing household economic strategies and placing them on trajectories of sustained economic advance. While sharing some similarities with older perspectives on asset redistribution, these new approaches reflect new learning on both the psychology of poverty and the economics of asset accumulation by poor households.</p> <p>With Michael R.

Utilizing weekly financial transaction data collected from households residing in a rural region of India, we estimate the impacts of India's COVID\u201019 lockdown on household income, food security, welfare, and access to local loan markets. A large portion of households living in our study region is reliant on remittances from migrants to sustain their livelihoods. Our analysis reveals that in the month immediately after India's lockdown announcement, weekly household local income fell by INR 1,022 (US$ 13.5), an 88% drop compared to the long\u2010term average with another 63% reduction in remittance. In response to the massive loss in earnings, households substantially reduced meal portions and consumed fewer food items. Impacts were heterogeneous; households in lower income quantiles lost a higher percentage of their income and expenditures, but government food aid slightly mitigated the negative impacts. We also find an increase in the effective interest rate of local borrowing in cash and a higher demand for in\u2010kind loans, which are likely to have an adverse effect on households who rely on such services. The results from this paper have immediate relevance to policymakers considering additional lockdowns as the COVID\u201019 pandemic resurges around the globe and to governments thinking about responses to future pandemics that may occur.</p> <p>PDF</p>"},{"location":"research/published/#applied-econometrics","title":"Applied Econometrics","text":""},{"location":"research/published/#fitting-and-interpreting-correlated-random-coefficient-models-using-stata","title":"Fitting and interpreting correlated random-coefficient models using Stata.","text":"<p>With Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Jeffrey D.

We use an innovative methodology that studies the adoption trajectories of farmers over a three-round panel data set to explain low adoption rates with heterogeneous returns to adoption. By relying on self-reported use of improved seeds, we find a puzzling answer for why farmers do not use new seed varieties: adoption leads to seemingly small and negative returns. Heterogeneity analysis across different levels of comparative advantage show that farmers who adopt don\u2019t actually have a comparative advantage in adopting improved seed, nor do they exhibit high returns to adopting. To reconcile this result with the expected higher yields for improved seeds, we exploit unique information on maize DNA-fingerprinting collected over the same areas in 2018. We find that the negative returns to adoption mask heterogeneity in the actual quality of the genetic material of the seeds farmers categorized as improved varieties in the self-reported data. Positive returns to adoption are found for those farmers that use higher-purity germplasm, drought-tolerant maize, and newly released varieties. When we account for misclassification in our heterogeneity analysis, we find that the puzzle is resolved. Our findings point to the wide dispersion of older and genetically diluted varieties, for which poorer farmers may be paying a premium. The implications of our findings speak to the need for policies to better target context and geography, expand accessibility of improved seeds, and make higher yields varieties more inclusive.</p> <p>PDF</p>"},{"location":"research/working/#livelihood-strategies-in-a-climate-change-vulnerable-region","title":"Livelihood Strategies in a Climate-change Vulnerable Region","text":"<p>with Miki Doan, Heng Zhu, Anubhab Gupta and Binoy Majumder</p> Abstract <p>Climate change has caused a disproportionate burden on the poor in developing coun- tries, who are primarily reliant on subsistence and small-scale agriculture for their liveli- hood.

Bird</p> Abstract <p>A large literature studies the effect of ethnicity on voting in developing countries. Yet empirically it is difficult to measure ethnicity at a scale necessary to disentangle the effect of ethnicity on voting from shared political goals that stem from living in the same location. This paper differentiates between the effects of a voter's ethnicity and their location on voting behavior. We estimate these effects by pairing voter registration data with election outcomes from polling stations throughout Uganda. We overcome the challenge of measuring ethnicity by using a machine learning algorithm that exploits variation in surnames across ethnic and linguistic groups. We use these ethnicity measures to estimate the effect of ethnicity on support for the incumbent president in the 2016 general election. We find that differences in voting by ethnicity are significant and do not vary between regions, suggesting the importance of measuring and studying ethnicity at scale.</p> <p>PDF</p>"},{"location":"research/working/#classification-into-ethnic-groups-in-burkina-faso-using-names-and-localities","title":"Classification into ethnic groups in Burkina Faso using names and localities","text":"<p>with Michael Kevane</p> Abstract <p>This paper reports on the geographic distribution of ethnic groups in Burkina Faso using approximately six million first and last names listed in electoral registries of 2012 and 2015. We construct, from credible ethnographic sources, an expert classification list of last names and first names associated with geographic places (villages, communes, provinces, and regions) and ethnic groups in Burkina Faso. Supervised machine learning used the alphabetic structure of names as well as geographic locations to assign ethnic labels to the unclassified names. The classification permits representation of ethnic diversity and polarisation at fine geographic scales, and concordance of the actual ethnic distribution of people with standard ethnic maps. We find substantial variance from the static picture conveyed by the standard ethnic maps. We use the classification to address an important contemporary social phenomenon in Burkina Faso, Mossi migration throughout the country. In many localities, the Mossi population is now larger than the population of the \u201cautochtonous\u201d ethnic group. Using the ethnically classified names in the voter registry data, we show that significant autochthonous ethnic discontinuities across borders appear to be associated with significant Mossi settlement discontinuities. That is, when borders sharply separate autochtonous ethnic groups, Mossi settlement patterns also exhibit larger discontinuities across borders. it may be that Mossi settlements are correlated with \u201chost\u201d conceptualizations of inter-ethnic accommodation. The possible endogenity of Mossi settlement patterns is a relevant consideration in evaluating popular discourses that an inevitable consequences of Mossi settlement will be rising inter-ethnic tension over political power and resource allocation.</p> <p>PDF</p>"},{"location":"research/working/#applied-econometrics","title":"Applied Econometrics","text":""},{"location":"research/working/#a-group-random-coefficient-approach-to-modeling-heterogeneous-returns-to-technology-adoption","title":"A Group Random Coefficient Approach to Modeling Heterogeneous Returns to Technology Adoption","text":"<p>With Emilia Tjernstrom, Dalia Ghanem, Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Travis J.

Drawing on recent developments in the nonparametric panel identification literature, we start with an unrestricted GRC model that nonparametrically identifies the returns to adoption under time homogeneity. We show that the parameters of the S2011 correlated random coefficient model (CRC) can be identified from a restricted version of the GRC method. Specifically, the model in S2011 implies a key restriction that we call linearity in comparative advantage (LCA). Our unrestricted GRC model can be used to detect identification concerns for key structural parameters from the CRC model.

This \u201csystems\u201d approach allows a grower to change their cropping decisions mid-rotation and plant higher value crops to address cash constraints while recognizing the effect of doing so on V. dahliae populations in the soil. A grower can plant broccoli to suppress the amount of microsclerotia ($\\mu s$) of disease in the soil, or plant lettuce if they need more cash in the current period. This flexibility represents a dynamic tradeoff whose intention is for suppressive crop rotations, but more broadly, it is relevant for any multi-crop production system. These production schemes must take streams of profits into account (not just profits from each crop separately), as well as any dynamic spillovers that crops may have on each other.  We use the results of a field study to calibrate a dynamic model to investigate how much this flexibility can change grower net returns, as well as how different market conditions, specifically expected prices, and levels of vertical coordination can change growers\u2019 rotation decisions in this systems context.</p>"},{"location":"teaching/teaching/","title":"Teaching","text":""},{"location":"teaching/teaching/#are-106-econometric-theory-and-applications","title":"ARE 106: Econometric Theory and Applications","text":"<p>This course focused on teaching the basics of Econometrics, starting with a rigorous derivation of OLS and the Gauss-Markov Theorem, and then discussing causation and threats to identification.
