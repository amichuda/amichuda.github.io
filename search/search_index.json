We use a novel method of connecting drivers to their rural places of origin using a machine learning classification using driver surnames We evaluate the existence of a shock based on a drought indices to find how adverse shocks affect labor supply behavior. \"Revisiting Selection and Comparative Advantage in Technology Adoption: A Structural Approach.\" with Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Jeffrey D.
