:::{#socials-heading-hack}

:::
I am an Assistant Research Professor at Cornell University's [Center for Data Science for Enterprise and Society](https://datasciencecenter.cornell.edu/).

My interests include development economics, transparency in social science and using machine learning to solve problems in development.

My research agenda encompasses two often interrelated topics: the first is using data science methods to bridge data gaps and construct novel datasets, and the second is applying these methods to solve problems in developing countries, especially in the context of the labor market. I am passionate about studying the effects of new technologies in developing countries and how they change household decision-making.
