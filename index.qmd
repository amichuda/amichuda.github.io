I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at the [Department of Economics at Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu/economics).

My interests include development economics, transparency in social science and using data science methods and code for research and teaching. I'm particularly interested in using data science to improve the quality of research in economics and the teaching of economics. 

Check out my [CV](cv/cv.qmd) for more information on my research and working papers.

Check out my [teaching page](teaching/teaching.qmd) for more information on my courses and course materials.

Check out the [Transparency and Reproducibility page](trans_rep.qmd) for my work in CRRESS and BITSS.

Finally, check out my [software page](software.qmd) for my open source software projects.
