Using the publicly available version of the dataset used in Suri (2011), cleaned per the author’s instructions, we are unable to replicate the paper’s main CRC model results. To understand why, we recast the CRC model as a more general random coefficient model in which the returns to hybrid adoption are restricted to be linear in comparative advantage. This reveals that the key structural parameter in the CRC model (\\(\\phi\\)) is prone to a weak identification problem. We then propose a procedure to conduct weak-identification robust inference on \\(\\phi\\) using test inversion. Only with this robust procedure accounting for weak identification are we able to reconcile the original Suri (2011) results.\n\n\n\nPDF"

We use an innovative methodology that studies the adoption trajectories of farmers over a three-round panel data set to explain low adoption rates with heterogeneous returns to adoption. By relying on self-reported use of improved seeds, we find a puzzling answer for why farmers do not use new seed varieties: adoption leads to seemingly small and negative returns. Heterogeneity analysis across different levels of comparative advantage show that farmers who adopt don’t actually have a comparative advantage in adopting improved seed, nor do they exhibit high returns to adopting. To reconcile this result with the expected higher yields for improved seeds, we exploit unique information on maize DNA-fingerprinting collected over the same areas in 2018. We find that the negative returns to adoption mask heterogeneity in the actual quality of the genetic material of the seeds farmers categorized as improved varieties in the self-reported data. Positive returns to adoption are found for those farmers that use higher-purity germplasm, drought-tolerant maize, and newly released varieties. When we account for misclassification in our heterogeneity analysis, we find that the puzzle is resolved. Our findings point to the wide dispersion of older and genetically diluted varieties, for which poorer farmers may be paying a premium. The implications of our findings speak to the need for policies to better target context and geography, expand accessibility of improved seeds, and make higher yields varieties more inclusive.\n\n\n\nPDF"

This paper contributes to our understanding of the livelihood diversification strategies of a vulnerable coastal population living in the Sundarbans region of India, an archipelago in the Bay of Bengal in India and Bangladesh that has been predicted to be on the brink of the largest exodus of the human populace. Using novel high- frequency weekly data collected over a year on a representative sample of households, this paper utilizes k-means clustering and unsupervised time-series clustering tech- niques to provide new insights into how poor households adapt to climate change. Our analysis highlights that households rely on multiple income sources and cope from week to week through mechanisms such as local borrowing, spousal income, or changes in expenditure. Households that rear livestock have volatile yet relatively high female income.\n\n\n\nPDF"

Bird\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nA large literature studies the effect of ethnicity on voting in developing countries. Yet empirically it is difficult to measure ethnicity at a scale necessary to disentangle the effect of ethnicity on voting from shared political goals that stem from living in the same location. This paper differentiates between the effects of a voter’s ethnicity and their location on voting behavior. We estimate these effects by pairing voter registration data with election outcomes from polling stations throughout Uganda. We overcome the challenge of measuring ethnicity by using a machine learning algorithm that exploits variation in surnames across ethnic and linguistic groups. We use these ethnicity measures to estimate the effect of ethnicity on support for the incumbent president in the 2016 general election. We find that differences in voting by ethnicity are significant and do not vary between regions, suggesting the importance of measuring and studying ethnicity at scale.\n\n\n\nPDF"

We construct, from credible ethnographic sources, an expert classification list of last names and first names associated with geographic places (villages, communes, provinces, and regions) and ethnic groups in Burkina Faso. Supervised machine learning used the alphabetic structure of names as well as geographic locations to assign ethnic labels to the unclassified names. The classification permits representation of ethnic diversity and polarisation at fine geographic scales, and concordance of the actual ethnic distribution of people with standard ethnic maps. We find substantial variance from the static picture conveyed by the standard ethnic maps. We use the classification to address an important contemporary social phenomenon in Burkina Faso, Mossi migration throughout the country. In many localities, the Mossi population is now larger than the population of the “autochtonous” ethnic group. Using the ethnically classified names in the voter registry data, we show that significant autochthonous ethnic discontinuities across borders appear to be associated with significant Mossi settlement discontinuities. That is, when borders sharply separate autochtonous ethnic groups, Mossi settlement patterns also exhibit larger discontinuities across borders. it may be that Mossi settlements are correlated with “host” conceptualizations of inter-ethnic accommodation. The possible endogenity of Mossi settlement patterns is a relevant consideration in evaluating popular discourses that an inevitable consequences of Mossi settlement will be rising inter-ethnic tension over political power and resource allocation.\n\n\n\nPDF"

This “systems” approach allows a grower to change their cropping decisions mid-rotation and plant higher value crops to address cash constraints while recognizing the effect of doing so on V. dahliae populations in the soil. A grower can plant broccoli to suppress the amount of microsclerotia (\\(\\mu s\\)) of disease in the soil, or plant lettuce if they need more cash in the current period. This flexibility represents a dynamic tradeoff whose intention is for suppressive crop rotations, but more broadly, it is relevant for any multi-crop production system. These production schemes must take streams of profits into account (not just profits from each crop separately), as well as any dynamic spillovers that crops may have on each other. We use the results of a field study to calibrate a dynamic model to investigate how much this flexibility can change grower net returns, as well as how different market conditions, specifically expected prices, and levels of vertical coordination can change growers’ rotation decisions in this systems context."

    "text": "Economic Impacts of the COVID-19 Lockdown in a Remittance‐Dependent Region\nWith Anubhab Gupta, Heng Zhu, Miki Khanh Doan, and Binoy Majumder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nThe economic impacts of COVID‐19 lockdowns on poor and vulnerable households living in rural areas of developing countries are not well understood due to a lack of detailed micro‐survey data at the household level. Utilizing weekly financial transaction data collected from households residing in a rural region of India, we estimate the impacts of India’s COVID‐19 lockdown on household income, food security, welfare, and access to local loan markets. A large portion of households living in our study region is reliant on remittances from migrants to sustain their livelihoods. Our analysis reveals that in the month immediately after India’s lockdown announcement, weekly household local income fell by INR 1,022 (US$ 13.5), an 88% drop compared to the long‐term average with another 63% reduction in remittance. In response to the massive loss in earnings, households substantially reduced meal portions and consumed fewer food items. Impacts were heterogeneous; households in lower income quantiles lost a higher percentage of their income and expenditures, but government food aid slightly mitigated the negative impacts. We also find an increase in the effective interest rate of local borrowing in cash and a higher demand for in‐kind loans, which are likely to have an adverse effect on households who rely on such services. The results from this paper have immediate relevance to policymakers considering additional lockdowns as the COVID‐19 pandemic resurges around the globe and to governments thinking about responses to future pandemics that may occur.\n\n\n\nPDF\n\n\nFitting and interpreting correlated random-coefficient models using Stata.\nWith Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Jeffrey D. Michler and Emilia Tjernstrom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this article, we introduce the community-contributed command randcoef, which fits the correlated random-effects and correlated random-coefficient models discussed in Suri (2011, Econometrica 79: 159–209). While this approach has been around for a decade, its use has been limited by the computationally intensive nature of the estimation procedure that relies on the optimal minimum distance estimator. randcoef can accommodate up to five rounds of panel data and offers several options, including alternative weight matrices for estimation and inclusion of additional endogenous regressors. We also present postestimation analysis using sample data to facilitate understanding and interpretation of results.\n\n\n\nPDF\n\n\nThe economic viability of suppressive crop rotations for the control of verticillium wilt in organic strawberry production.\nWith Rachael Goodhue, Karen Klonsky, Graeme Baird, Lucinda Toyama, Margarita Zavatta, and Carol Shennan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil-borne diseases and nitrogen availability are important limits on organic strawberry production. A trial using suppressive crop rotations to combat Verticillium wilt was conducted to see its effects on strawberry yields and net returns using a split-split-plot design. An ANOVA analysis was run to understand determinants of net returns. Results show that the suppression of wilt through the planting of non-host crops such as broccoli before the planting of strawberries can have significant effects on yield and net returns, and that suppressive crop rotations are potentially commercially viable.\n\n\n\nPDF\n\n\nPredicting net returns of organic and conventional strawberry following soil disinfestation with steam or steam plus additives\nWith Rachael Goodhue, Mark Hoffmann and Steve A. Fennimore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-plant methods for managing soil-borne pests and diseases are an important priority for many agricultural production systems. This study investigates whether the application of steam is an economically sustainable pre-plant soil disinfestation technique for organic and conventional strawberry production in California’s Central Coast region. We analyze net returns ha -1 from field trials using steam and steam + mustard seed meal (MSM) as pre-plant soil disinfestation treatments. ANOVA tests identify statistically significant differences in net revenues by treatment and trial. Multivariate regressions estimate the magnitude of these effects. Predictive polynomial models identify relationships between net returns ha -1 and two treatment characteristics: maximum temperature (⁰ C) and time at ≥ 60⁰ C (minutes). For organic production, net returns ha -1 are statistically similar for the steam and steam + MSM treatments. For conventional production, the steam + MSM treatment has significantly higher net returns ha -1 than the steam treatment. Polynomial models outperform the sample mean for prediction of net returns ha -1 except for the steam + MSM treatment in conventional production. Results from two of three organic models suggest that maximum soil temperatures of 62-63⁰ C achieved for 41-44 minutes maximizes net returns ha -1 and may be a basis for further experiments.\n\n\n\nPDF\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

This course serves as an entry point for students wishing to continue their study of economics as well students that want to learn about the core concepts of economics. The goal of this course is not just to introduce you to the terms and parlance that economists use, but to provide a set of tools for asking and answering questions to problems. At the heart of economics, the central question is: how do people make decisions when faced with constraints and limited resources? What impact do these constraints have on their lives how does it scale up to people making decisions within a society? How do incentives play a vital role in these decisions?\n\nSyllabus\n\n\n\n\nThis course is an introduction to the field of econometrics, with a focus on the fundamental principles and techniques of descriptive and inferential statistics. The course also emphasizes economic applications of statistical methods, particularly simple and multiple regression models. The course recognizes the importance of the underlying modeling assumptions and the challenges of empirically distinguishing correlation from causation.\n\nSyllabus\nCourse Website\n\n\n\n\nThe course introduces students to basic practices and tools that will enhance your ability to conduct empirical research and analysis in microeconomics in a data-rich world.

The course format is “hands-on” and students will conduct most of their work on their personal computers using python and VSCode.\n\nSyllabus\nLectures\n\n\n\n\nThis course focused on teaching the basics of Econometrics, starting with a rigorous derivation of OLS and the Gauss-Markov Theorem, and then discussing causation and threats to identification. The course was taught with practicality in mind, and so students learned a programming language which could help them in whatever career direction they decided to go: python. Homework assignments were done in Jupyter notebooks, which included both code and derivation. The course was meant to teach both econometrics as well as more efficient workflows and data management.\n\nSyllabus\nHomework Assignments and Lectures in Python"
