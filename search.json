    "text": "CRRESS\n\nThe Conference on Reproducibility and Replicability in Economics and the Social Sciences is a series of NSF-funded, virtual and in-person panels on the topics of reproducibility, replicability, and transparency in the social sciences. The purpose of scientific publishing is the dissemination of robust research findings, exposing them to the scrutiny of peers and other interested parties. Scientific articles should accurately and completely provide information on the origin and provenance of data and on the analytical and computational methods used. Yet in recent years, doubts about the adequacy of the information provided in scientific articles and their addenda have been voiced. The conferences will address the following topics: the initiation of research, the conduct of research, the preparation of research for publication, and the scrutiny after publication. Undergraduates, graduate students, and career researchers will be able to learn about best practices for transparent, reproducible, and scientifically sound research in the social sciences.\n\nAccess the book here"

Utilizing weekly financial transaction data collected from households residing in a rural region of India, we estimate the impacts of India’s COVID‐19 lockdown on household income, food security, welfare, and access to local loan markets. A large portion of households living in our study region is reliant on remittances from migrants to sustain their livelihoods. Our analysis reveals that in the month immediately after India’s lockdown announcement, weekly household local income fell by INR 1,022 (US$ 13.5), an 88% drop compared to the long‐term average with another 63% reduction in remittance. In response to the massive loss in earnings, households substantially reduced meal portions and consumed fewer food items. Impacts were heterogeneous; households in lower income quantiles lost a higher percentage of their income and expenditures, but government food aid slightly mitigated the negative impacts. We also find an increase in the effective interest rate of local borrowing in cash and a higher demand for in‐kind loans, which are likely to have an adverse effect on households who rely on such services. The results from this paper have immediate relevance to policymakers considering additional lockdowns as the COVID‐19 pandemic resurges around the globe and to governments thinking about responses to future pandemics that may occur.\n\n\n\nPDF\n\n\nFitting and interpreting correlated random-coefficient models using Stata.\nWith Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Jeffrey D. Michler and Emilia Tjernstrom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this article, we introduce the community-contributed command randcoef, which fits the correlated random-effects and correlated random-coefficient models discussed in Suri (2011, Econometrica 79: 159–209). While this approach has been around for a decade, its use has been limited by the computationally intensive nature of the estimation procedure that relies on the optimal minimum distance estimator. randcoef can accommodate up to five rounds of panel data and offers several options, including alternative weight matrices for estimation and inclusion of additional endogenous regressors. We also present postestimation analysis using sample data to facilitate understanding and interpretation of results.\n\n\n\nPDF\n\n\nThe economic viability of suppressive crop rotations for the control of verticillium wilt in organic strawberry production.\nWith Rachael Goodhue, Karen Klonsky, Graeme Baird, Lucinda Toyama, Margarita Zavatta, and Carol Shennan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil-borne diseases and nitrogen availability are important limits on organic strawberry production. A trial using suppressive crop rotations to combat Verticillium wilt was conducted to see its effects on strawberry yields and net returns using a split-split-plot design. An ANOVA analysis was run to understand determinants of net returns. Results show that the suppression of wilt through the planting of non-host crops such as broccoli before the planting of strawberries can have significant effects on yield and net returns, and that suppressive crop rotations are potentially commercially viable.\n\n\n\nPDF\n\n\nPredicting net returns of organic and conventional strawberry following soil disinfestation with steam or steam plus additives\nWith Rachael Goodhue, Mark Hoffmann and Steve A. Fennimore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-plant methods for managing soil-borne pests and diseases are an important priority for many agricultural production systems. This study investigates whether the application of steam is an economically sustainable pre-plant soil disinfestation technique for organic and conventional strawberry production in California’s Central Coast region. We analyze net returns ha -1 from field trials using steam and steam + mustard seed meal (MSM) as pre-plant soil disinfestation treatments. ANOVA tests identify statistically significant differences in net revenues by treatment and trial. Multivariate regressions estimate the magnitude of these effects. Predictive polynomial models identify relationships between net returns ha -1 and two treatment characteristics: maximum temperature (⁰ C) and time at ≥ 60⁰ C (minutes). For organic production, net returns ha -1 are statistically similar for the steam and steam + MSM treatments. For conventional production, the steam + MSM treatment has significantly higher net returns ha -1 than the steam treatment. Polynomial models outperform the sample mean for prediction of net returns ha -1 except for the steam + MSM treatment in conventional production. Results from two of three organic models suggest that maximum soil temperatures of 62-63⁰ C achieved for 41-44 minutes maximizes net returns ha -1 and may be a basis for further experiments.\n\n\n\nPDF\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Urban Labor Supply Responses to Weather Shocks for Ugandan Uber Drivers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nRural-urban linkages have long been a topic of study in the developing world. Remit- tances are often a key driver of these linkages and can act as insurance against rural weather shock risk, in the absence of availability and access to formal insurance products. The emergence of new technologies, such as ride-share and mobile money platforms can be potentially transformative in allowing remittance flows to adjust more quickly to ad- verse shocks. I use a dataset of Uber driver labor supply and a rich dataset of weather indicators to estimate the effect of adverse weather shocks in rural areas on Uber drivers in Kampala, Uganda. Since I do not have explicit information on migrant status and rural connection, I leverage an external dataset of Ugandan voter registration and train a gradient boosting classifier on Ugandan surnames to predict drivers’ regions of ori- gin. I develop a switching regression estimator with exogenous switching probabilities to address the misclassification bias from the predictions. I find that a one standard deviation increase in the intensity of an agricultural shock, measured as a reduction in biomass growth, is associated with an increase of around 7 hours online in the same week, which amounts to a 20% over average hours, and then a precipitous decline in the week after. The same dynamics occur for earnings. I find that this behavior might be due to extensive margin effects driven by drivers leaving the platform for short periods. Dynamics change with whether the shock happens during the planting season of crops or not.\n\n\n\nPDF"

We use an innovative methodology that studies the adoption trajectories of farmers over a three-round panel data set to explain low adoption rates with heterogeneous returns to adoption. By relying on self-reported use of improved seeds, we find a puzzling answer for why farmers do not use new seed varieties: adoption leads to seemingly small and negative returns. Heterogeneity analysis across different levels of comparative advantage show that farmers who adopt don’t actually have a comparative advantage in adopting improved seed, nor do they exhibit high returns to adopting. To reconcile this result with the expected higher yields for improved seeds, we exploit unique information on maize DNA-fingerprinting collected over the same areas in 2018. We find that the negative returns to adoption mask heterogeneity in the actual quality of the genetic material of the seeds farmers categorized as improved varieties in the self-reported data. Positive returns to adoption are found for those farmers that use higher-purity germplasm, drought-tolerant maize, and newly released varieties. When we account for misclassification in our heterogeneity analysis, we find that the puzzle is resolved. Our findings point to the wide dispersion of older and genetically diluted varieties, for which poorer farmers may be paying a premium. The implications of our findings speak to the need for policies to better target context and geography, expand accessibility of improved seeds, and make higher yields varieties more inclusive.\n\n\n\nPDF"

This paper contributes to our understanding of the livelihood diversification strategies of a vulnerable coastal population living in the Sundarbans region of India, an archipelago in the Bay of Bengal in India and Bangladesh that has been predicted to be on the brink of the largest exodus of the human populace. Using novel high- frequency weekly data collected over a year on a representative sample of households, this paper utilizes k-means clustering and unsupervised time-series clustering tech- niques to provide new insights into how poor households adapt to climate change. Our analysis highlights that households rely on multiple income sources and cope from week to week through mechanisms such as local borrowing, spousal income, or changes in expenditure. Households that rear livestock have volatile yet relatively high female income.\n\n\n\nPDF"

    "text": "Measuring Ethnicity and Estimating its Effects on Voting at Scale: Evidence from Uganda\nWith Samuel S. Bird\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nA large literature studies the effect of ethnicity on voting in developing countries. Yet empirically it is difficult to measure ethnicity at a scale necessary to disentangle the effect of ethnicity on voting from shared political goals that stem from living in the same location. This paper differentiates between the effects of a voter’s ethnicity and their location on voting behavior. We estimate these effects by pairing voter registration data with election outcomes from polling stations throughout Uganda. We overcome the challenge of measuring ethnicity by using a machine learning algorithm that exploits variation in surnames across ethnic and linguistic groups. We use these ethnicity measures to estimate the effect of ethnicity on support for the incumbent president in the 2016 general election. We find that differences in voting by ethnicity are significant and do not vary between regions, suggesting the importance of measuring and studying ethnicity at scale.\n\n\n\nPDF"

    "text": "Classification into ethnic groups in Burkina Faso using names and localities\nwith Michael Kevane\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nThis paper reports on the geographic distribution of ethnic groups in Burkina Faso using approximately six million first and last names listed in electoral registries of 2012 and 2015. We construct, from credible ethnographic sources, an expert classification list of last names and first names associated with geographic places (villages, communes, provinces, and regions) and ethnic groups in Burkina Faso. Supervised machine learning used the alphabetic structure of names as well as geographic locations to assign ethnic labels to the unclassified names. The classification permits representation of ethnic diversity and polarisation at fine geographic scales, and concordance of the actual ethnic distribution of people with standard ethnic maps. We find substantial variance from the static picture conveyed by the standard ethnic maps. We use the classification to address an important contemporary social phenomenon in Burkina Faso, Mossi migration throughout the country. In many localities, the Mossi population is now larger than the population of the “autochtonous” ethnic group. Using the ethnically classified names in the voter registry data, we show that significant autochthonous ethnic discontinuities across borders appear to be associated with significant Mossi settlement discontinuities. That is, when borders sharply separate autochtonous ethnic groups, Mossi settlement patterns also exhibit larger discontinuities across borders. it may be that Mossi settlements are correlated with “host” conceptualizations of inter-ethnic accommodation. The possible endogenity of Mossi settlement patterns is a relevant consideration in evaluating popular discourses that an inevitable consequences of Mossi settlement will be rising inter-ethnic tension over political power and resource allocation.\n\n\n\nPDF"

Lybbert, and Jeffrey D. Michler\nRevise and Resubmit, Econometrica\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nOur paper revisits the econometric model that Suri (2011) (S2011) used in her study of heterogeneous returns to agricultural technology adoption. We propose an alternative group random coefficient (GRC) estimation strategy and revisit the empirical puzzle of why relatively few sub-Saharan farmers adopt modern technologies. Drawing on recent developments in the nonparametric panel identification literature, we start with an unrestricted GRC model that nonparametrically identifies the returns to adoption under time homogeneity. We show that the parameters of the S2011 correlated random coefficient model (CRC) can be identified from a restricted version of the GRC method. Specifically, the model in S2011 implies a key restriction that we call linearity in comparative advantage (LCA). Our unrestricted GRC model can be used to detect identification concerns for key structural parameters from the CRC model. We illustrate our method using the same data set as the original study and find that the motivating empirical puzzle remains unsolved.\n\n\n\nPDF"

    "text": "Evaluating a Systems Approach to Suppressive Crop Rotations in Strawberry Production\nWith Rachael Goodhue, Daniel Chellemi, and Krishna Subbarao\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nWe evaluate a new, dynamic approach to suppressive crop rotations, which incorporate flexibility in cropping decisions. This “systems” approach allows a grower to change their cropping decisions mid-rotation and plant higher value crops to address cash constraints while recognizing the effect of doing so on V. dahliae populations in the soil. A grower can plant broccoli to suppress the amount of microsclerotia (\\(\\mu s\\)) of disease in the soil, or plant lettuce if they need more cash in the current period. This flexibility represents a dynamic tradeoff whose intention is for suppressive crop rotations, but more broadly, it is relevant for any multi-crop production system. These production schemes must take streams of profits into account (not just profits from each crop separately), as well as any dynamic spillovers that crops may have on each other. We use the results of a field study to calibrate a dynamic model to investigate how much this flexibility can change grower net returns, as well as how different market conditions, specifically expected prices, and levels of vertical coordination can change growers’ rotation decisions in this systems context."

Carter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, academic and policy debates on agrarian issues often spun around the distribution of land, with some arguing that neither rural development nor poverty reduction was possible without asset redistribution. While resting on defensible theoretical foundations, the argument for large-scale redistribution gave way to microfinance and other less radical interventions intended to allow low wealth households to do more with their existing, modest asset endowments. While also resting on defensible theoretical foundations, this “lend, don’t redistribute wealth” perspective coincided with a shift of development economics away from big picture theorizing towards an impact evaluation economics focused on reliable identification of microfinance and other singular interventions. Interestingly, despite the promise of microfinance to substitute for asset redistribution, impact evaluation economics found it to have at best modest effects on the class positions and living standards of poor households. In a perhaps ironic twist, a new generation of programs built around the transfer of tangible assets has shown much more promise in terms of changing household economic strategies and placing them on trajectories of sustained economic advance. While sharing some similarities with older perspectives on asset redistribution, these new approaches reflect new learning on both the psychology of poverty and the economics of asset accumulation by poor households.\n\n\n\nPDF"
