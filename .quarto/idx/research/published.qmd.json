Utilizing weekly financial transaction data collected from households residing in a rural region of India, we estimate the impacts of India's COVID‐19 lockdown on household income, food security, welfare, and access to local loan markets. A large portion of households living in our study region is reliant on remittances from migrants to sustain their livelihoods. Our analysis reveals that in the month immediately after India's lockdown announcement, weekly household local income fell by INR 1,022 (US$ 13.5), an 88% drop compared to the long‐term average with another 63% reduction in remittance. In response to the massive loss in earnings, households substantially reduced meal portions and consumed fewer food items. Impacts were heterogeneous; households in lower income quantiles lost a higher percentage of their income and expenditures, but government food aid slightly mitigated the negative impacts. We also find an increase in the effective interest rate of local borrowing in cash and a higher demand for in‐kind loans, which are likely to have an adverse effect on households who rely on such services. The results from this paper have immediate relevance to policymakers considering additional lockdowns as the COVID‐19 pandemic resurges around the globe and to governments thinking about responses to future pandemics that may occur.\n:::\n\n[PDF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajae.12178){.btn .btn-outline-primary .btn role=\"button\"}\n\n### Fitting and interpreting correlated random-coefficient models using Stata.\n\n*With Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Jeffrey D.

This study investigates   whether the application of steam\nis an economically sustainable pre-plant soil disinfestation    technique for organic and\nconventional strawberry production in California’s Central  Coast region. We analyze net\nreturns ha -1 from field trials using steam and steam +     mustard seed meal (MSM) as pre-plant\nsoil disinfestation treatments. ANOVA tests identify    statistically significant differences in net\nrevenues by treatment and trial. Multivariate regressions   estimate the magnitude of these\neffects. Predictive polynomial models identify relationships    between net returns ha -1 and two\ntreatment characteristics: maximum temperature (⁰ C) and time   at ≥ 60⁰ C (minutes). For\norganic production, net returns ha -1 are statistically     similar for the steam and steam + MSM\ntreatments. For conventional production, the steam + MSM    treatment has significantly higher\nnet returns ha -1 than the steam treatment. Polynomial models   outperform the sample mean for\nprediction of net returns ha -1 except for the steam + MSM  treatment in conventional\nproduction. Results from two of three organic models suggest    that maximum soil temperatures\nof 62-63⁰ C achieved for 41-44 minutes maximizes net returns    ha -1 and may be a basis for\nfurther experiments.\n:::\n\n[PDF](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/11/1/149){.btn .btn-outline-primary .btn role=\"button\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n### Economic Impacts of the COVID-19 Lockdown in a Remittance‐Dependent Region\n\n*With Anubhab Gupta, Heng Zhu, Miki Khanh Doan, and Binoy Majumder*\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThe economic impacts of COVID‐19 lockdowns on poor and vulnerable households living in rural areas of developing countries are not well understood due to a lack of detailed micro‐survey data at the household level.
