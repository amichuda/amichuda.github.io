The emergence of new technologies, such as ride-share and mobile money platforms can be potentially transformative in allowing remittance flows to adjust more quickly to ad- verse shocks. I use a dataset of Uber driver labor supply and a rich dataset of weather indicators to estimate the effect of adverse weather shocks in rural areas on Uber drivers in Kampala, Uganda. Since I do not have explicit information on migrant status and rural connection, I leverage an external dataset of Ugandan voter registration and train a gradient boosting classifier on Ugandan surnames to predict drivers’ regions of ori- gin. I develop a switching regression estimator with exogenous switching probabilities to address the misclassification bias from the predictions. I find that a one standard deviation increase in the intensity of an agricultural shock, measured as a reduction in biomass growth, is associated with an increase of around 7 hours online in the same week, which amounts to a 20% over average hours, and then a precipitous decline in the week after. The same dynamics occur for earnings. I find that this behavior might be due to extensive margin effects driven by drivers leaving the platform for short periods.

Heterogeneity analysis across different\nlevels of comparative advantage show that farmers who adopt don’t actually have a comparative\nadvantage in adopting improved seed, nor do they exhibit high returns to adopting. To reconcile\nthis result with the expected higher yields for improved seeds, we exploit unique information\non maize DNA-fingerprinting collected over the same areas in 2018. We find that the negative\nreturns to adoption mask heterogeneity in the actual quality of the genetic material of the seeds\nfarmers categorized as improved varieties in the self-reported data. Positive returns to adoption\nare found for those farmers that use higher-purity germplasm, drought-tolerant maize, and newly\nreleased varieties. When we account for misclassification in our heterogeneity analysis, we find\nthat the puzzle is resolved.

Bird*\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nA large literature studies the effect of ethnicity on voting in developing countries. Yet empirically it is difficult to measure ethnicity at a scale necessary to disentangle the effect of ethnicity on voting from shared political goals that stem from living in the same location. This paper differentiates between the effects of a voter's ethnicity and their location on voting behavior. We estimate these effects by pairing voter registration data with election outcomes from polling stations throughout Uganda. We overcome the challenge of measuring ethnicity by using a machine learning algorithm that exploits variation in surnames across ethnic and linguistic groups. We use these ethnicity measures to estimate the effect of ethnicity on support for the incumbent president in the 2016 general election. We find that differences in voting by ethnicity are significant and do not vary between regions, suggesting the importance of measuring and studying ethnicity at scale.\n:::\n\n[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tdmr2_4DCSXIt_Q7tq1omglsgn249VgE/view?usp=sharing){.btn .btn-outline-primary .btn role=\"button\"}\n\n## Classification into ethnic groups in Burkina Faso using names and localities\n\n*with Michael Kevane*\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThis paper reports on the geographic distribution of ethnic groups in Burkina Faso\nusing approximately six million first and last names listed in electoral registries of 2012 and 2015.\nWe construct, from credible ethnographic sources, an expert classification list of last names and\nfirst names associated with geographic places (villages, communes, provinces, and regions) and\nethnic groups in Burkina Faso. Supervised machine learning used the alphabetic structure of\nnames as well as geographic locations to assign ethnic labels to the unclassified names. The\nclassification permits representation of ethnic diversity and polarisation at fine geographic scales,\nand concordance of the actual ethnic distribution of people with standard ethnic maps. We find\nsubstantial variance from the static picture conveyed by the standard ethnic maps. We use the\nclassification to address an important contemporary social phenomenon in Burkina Faso, Mossi\nmigration throughout the country. In many localities, the Mossi population is now larger than the\npopulation of the “autochtonous” ethnic group. Using the ethnically classified names in the voter\nregistry data, we show that significant autochthonous ethnic discontinuities across borders appear\nto be associated with significant Mossi settlement discontinuities. That is, when borders sharply\nseparate autochtonous ethnic groups, Mossi settlement patterns also exhibit larger discontinuities\nacross borders. it may be that Mossi settlements are correlated with “host” conceptualizations of\ninter-ethnic accommodation. The possible endogenity of Mossi settlement patterns is a relevant\nconsideration in evaluating popular discourses that an inevitable consequences of Mossi settlement\nwill be rising inter-ethnic tension over political power and resource allocation.\n:::\n\n[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZCS0c89GkS4hio5WEUrMSnqJ1FYeMd0V/view?usp=sharing){.btn .btn-outline-primary .btn role=\"button\"}\n\n## A Group Random Coefficient Approach to Modeling Heterogeneous Returns to Technology Adoption\n\n*With Emilia Tjernstrom, Dalia Ghanem, Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Travis J.

Michler*\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nOur paper revisits the econometric model that Suri (2011) (S2011) used in her study of heterogeneous returns to agricultural technology adoption. We propose an alternative group random coefficient (GRC) estimation strategy and revisit the empirical puzzle of why relatively few sub-Saharan farmers adopt modern technologies. Drawing on recent developments in the nonparametric panel identification literature, we start with an unrestricted GRC model that nonparametrically identifies the returns to adoption under time homogeneity. We show that the parameters of the S2011 correlated random coefficient model (CRC) can be identified from a restricted version of the GRC method. Specifically, the model in S2011 implies a key restriction that we call linearity in comparative advantage (LCA). Our unrestricted GRC model can be used to detect identification concerns for key structural parameters from the CRC model. We illustrate our method using the same data set as the original study and find that the motivating empirical puzzle remains unsolved.\n:::\n\n[PDF](https://emiliatjernstrom.com/files/TGBLMM2020.pdf){.btn .btn-outline-primary .btn role=\"button\"}\n\n## Evaluating a Systems Approach to Suppressive Crop Rotations in Strawberry Production\n\n*With Rachael Goodhue, Daniel Chellemi, and Krishna Subbarao*\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nWe evaluate a new, dynamic approach to suppressive crop rotations, which incorporate flexibility in cropping decisions. This “systems” approach allows a grower to change their cropping decisions mid-rotation and plant higher value crops to address cash constraints while recognizing the effect of doing so on V. dahliae populations in the soil. A grower can plant broccoli to suppress the amount of microsclerotia ($\\mu s$) of disease in the soil, or plant lettuce if they need more cash in the current period. This flexibility represents a dynamic tradeoff whose intention is for suppressive crop rotations, but more broadly, it is relevant for any multi-crop production system. These production schemes must take streams of profits into account (not just profits from each crop separately), as well as any dynamic spillovers that crops may have on each other.  We use the results of a field study to calibrate a dynamic model to investigate how much this flexibility can change grower net returns, as well as how different market conditions, specifically expected prices, and levels of vertical coordination can change growers’ rotation decisions in this systems context.\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Urban Labor Supply Responses to Weather Shocks for Ugandan Uber Drivers\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nRural-urban linkages have long been a topic of study in the developing world.
